# Making Change

## Problem

Write a solution that allows someone to make change using the least
number of coins.  To keep things simple, assume that whole dollar
amounts are already taken care of, so you need to handle making change
for 0 to 99 cents.

## Example
The change for 55 cents is two quarters and a nickel.

The point isn't to solve the problem, but to improve your skills.  Use
this as a chance to try something new, or to learn from a friend:

* "TDD as if you meant it"
* clojure.test
* Eclipse + Counterclockwise
* Emacs + SLIME
* Leiningen
* Netbeans + Enclojure
* CLI?  GUI?  Web?

## Rules

1. 20 minutes per round
2. Code with a partner
3. *Delete __all__ your code at the end of each round*
